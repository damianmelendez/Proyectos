4th. Answer the questions to give your conclusion.

1. What do you like best or respect the most about your parents’ generation?
(Idea principal: Su ética de trabajo y el valor que le daban a las relaciones personales)

	+++++I respect their work ethic and how they used to balance their professional duties with family life.
	I appreciate that they used to rely more on face-to-face communication, considering that technology was hardly available.
	I am glad about their strong sense of community; they focused more on personal relationships than on online interactions.
	I admire their sense of responsibility and how they put a lot of effort into everything they did.
	Their values on loyalty and commitment in relationships and jobs are a quality I deeply respect.
	The fact that they hardly ever had distractions like the internet meant they could focus on the people around them.

2. What contributions do you think your generation will make to the next generation?
(Idea principal: Mayor conciencia y apertura sobre la salud mental)

	Our generation will contribute a more open conversation about mental health and well-being.
	++++I believe we will normalize talking about the pros and cons of mental health issues, making it less of a taboo subject.
	We will provide a framework for a healthy give and take between stress and relaxation, which will benefit the next generation's mental health.
	Our contribution will be a greater emphasis on emotional intelligence and the importance of self-care, due to our own experiences.
	We will help create a world where seeking help for mental health is as common as seeking help for a physical injury.
	I think we will leave a legacy of compassion and understanding for people struggling with mental health issues.

3. How do you think the next generation will differ from yours?
(Idea principal: Su conexión aún más profunda con la tecnología, especialmente la IA)

	+++The next generation will be much more integrated with technology, having been born with a smart Device in their hands.
	I think they will differ from us because they will be used to an Overwhelming amount of information and AI in their daily lives.
	They will hardly know a world without sophisticated AI, making them more adaptable to new technologies.
	They will probably be more accustomed to learning from machines and using AI as a tool for all their duties.
	I believe they will be alike to our generation in their use of social media, but they'll be far more advanced in their interaction with artificial intelligence.
	They might develop different social skills due to a higher reliance on digital communication from a very young age.
