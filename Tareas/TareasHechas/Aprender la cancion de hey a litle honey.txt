hey there litle honey wont you groove
i´been trying all night to dance with you
hey there litle lonly wont you stay
i said "i would rather die than feel this pain

you said " i know i feel very much the same
but i am afraid that i dont know, knowling is not my thing
but i woul like to dance with you
Awkwardly in haze
to this little tune
